# Simple-Cloud-Identifier
Cloud formation identifier - trainable classification model using convolutional neural networks

This model trains on labeled cloud images

End Goal is to have a web interface to submit a cloud photo and it should give you a classification

Different cloud types - 
Cirriform
Clear sky
Cumulonimbus
Cumulus
High Cumuliform
Stratiform
StratoCumulus

Note: Dataset is imbalanced, Cumulonimbus is underrepresented compared to High Cumuliform. Model may perform poorly on underrepresented classes.
